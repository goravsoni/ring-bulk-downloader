# Ring Camera Bulk Video Downloader

## **Why?**

Ring Doorbell/Floodlight only allows you to download 20 recorded events at a time. 
This is not ideal for someone trying to download events for the entire week or month. An average Ring product
gets up to 100-200 motion events daily. While these are conveniently logged and accessible on the Ring app 
they are destroyed in 60 days. Additionally, sharing footage to authorities can be a tedious task.
