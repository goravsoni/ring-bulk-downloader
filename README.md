# Ring Camera Bulk Video Downloader

## **Why?**

Ring Doorbell/Floodlight only allows you to download 20 recorded events at a time. 
This is not ideal for someone trying to download events for the entire week or month. An average Ring product
logs up to 250-400 motion events everyday. While these are conveniently  accessible on the Ring app 
they are destroyed in 60 days. Additionally, sharing footage to authorities can be a tedious task.

## **My Instance**

I was able to download over 3500 videos in HQ (LQ is available aswell) surrounding an event that lasted a week on the Ring Floodcamera.
The total size of my files came out to 42 GB. This is still not ideal. I hope Ring builds a time lapse feature that can round up videos from a week and 
show a 3 minute time lapse.  It took me about 2 hours to get everything downloaded and backed up to Google Drive. Thanks to Google drive desktop
